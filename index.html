    <h1>Reverend Takes Action to Fight Human Trafficking in New York City</h1>

      <p class="cap">Rev. Adrian Dannhauser gets ready for a Sunday service at Church of the Incarnation, Irene Spezzamonte
      </p>

      <p> When Adrian Dannhauser was in theological seminary to become a minister,she took a course on female mystics and read the book “The Silent Cry” about oppressed people whose cries go unheard.
      </p>

      <p>Dannhauser decided to hear that cry: the cry of victims of human trafficking. As the minister of the Church of the Incarnation on Madison Avenue in Murray Hill, she has been working to fight human trafficking for two years.
      </p>

      <p>“I was very resistant about starting to work on this issue, but I would go to the dentist office and the TV in the waiting room had a talk show with someone who was a trafficking victim or I would go to the gym and on the elliptical machine there
        was a magazine opened up to an article about girls being trafficked in Mexico.” Dannhauser, 39, said. “I was having dreams...awful dreams about this subject and that’s what got my attention and finally realized that this was God telling me to
        do something.”
      </p>

      <p> Human trafficking is increasing in New York State, statistics show. The number of cases in the state rose by 13 percent from 2015 toin 2016, according to <a href="https://humantraffickinghotline.org/state/new-york" target="_blank"> the National Human Trafficking Hotline.</a>        The hotline ranked New York City as <a href="https://humantraffickinghotline.org/sites/default/files/100%20Most%20Populous%20Cities%20Report.pdf" target="_blank"> the city with the second-largest number of calls </a> on human trafficking received
        between December 2007 and December 2016. Hotels are a leading venue for potential trafficking, the hotline found.

      <p> Because the Episcopal church where Dannhauser is a minister is in a part of Manhattan with many hotels, she started reaching out to hotels in the neighborhood to see if they were “up to speed” on the risks of trafficking.

      <p class="cap">Rev. Adrian Dannhauser as she makes some research on human trafficking, Irene Spezzamonte
      </p>

      <p> The American Hotel Lodging Association offers online training to hotels and their employees on how to recognize and prevent human trafficking. <a href="https://www.ahla.com/issues/human-trafficking" target="_blank"> The training </a> is not mandatory
        and facilities must pay a fee based on the number of the rooms in the hotel to have access to it. Dannhauser reached out to Erica Green, the area sales manager for the Hampton Hill near Grand Central, and found out the hotel had purchased the
        training, but never utilized it.
      </p>

      <p> “Adrian really started us down the road,.” Green, 28, of Brooklyn said. “It is a topic in hotels that in my experience – isn’t spoken about enough. It can be right in front of a front desk agent or a housekeeper, but without proper training and
        encouragement to report these instances no response or retaliation would be taken.”
      </p>

      <p>Currently, Dannhauser said she is working on putting together a tool kit to distribute to hotels for their front desks with some of the signs and red flags about human trafficking.
      </p>

      <p>“Not every good deed has our name on it, but we serve a God who calls us by name. And God has something for all of us to do. This was mine.” she said.
